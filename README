NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RemovePhasedPrereqs - Remove gathered prereqs from
    particular phases

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

        [RemovePhasedPrereqs]
        remove_runtime = Foo
        remove_runtime = Bar

DESCRIPTION
    This module is adapted from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RemovePrereqs to let
    you specify particular requirements sections to remove from instead of
    removing from all of them.

    Valid configuration options are:

    *   remove_build

    *   remove_configure

    *   remove_develop

    *   remove_runtime

    *   remove_test

    These may be used more than once to remove multiple modules.

    Modules are removed from all types within a section (e.g. "requires",
    "recommends", "suggests", etc.).
